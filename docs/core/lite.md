# GHOSTS LITE

Generate web requests and file creation activity with minimal resources (good for when participants lack host access).

## Overview

### What is GHOSTS LITE?
GHOSTS LITE is a streamlined version of the GHOSTS framework, designed to simulate realistic network activity without the overhead of running actual applications. It programmatically generates web browsing traffic and file creation, emulating real-user actions without launching resource-intensive applications.

### Purpose
GHOSTS LITE was created to provide an efficient tool for simulating network activity. If you don't give participants access to the host, there is perhaps no need to launch applications like web browsers or office suites â€” so, GHOSTS LITE reduces resource consumption, including CPU, storage, and memory, simplifying the simulation process and requiring less resources to run.

### Objectives
- Efficiency: Minimize the resources required to simulate user activity on a network.
- Simplicity: Simplify installation and configuration compared to the full GHOSTS framework.
- Realism: Preserve the ability to generate realistic network activity.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the .NET framework installed on your system.

### Download and install ghosts-lite

1. **Download the latest release**
2. **Extract the downloaded archive** to a directory of your choice.
3. **Open terminal** and navigate to the directory where you extracted ghosts-lite
